# Blocks and Inputs

![](https://github.com/hoc-labs/images/blob/main/branchesCycle.gif?raw=true)


On this page, you will create many different pictures (like the ones above) by creating a single block with an input parameter: Input parameters allow one block to do many related jobs.


### Command Block with Single Input
Follow the directions in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByQqv1wHXg3rM0RsNVdmN21Nek0/view?usp=sharing) to create a command block to draw a pinwheel shape with an input parameter to specify the number of branches. 

Create the block in the **Motion** palette.

These were made with the pinwheel block.

### Adding Multiple Inputs

Now you will modify your existing pinwheel block so that you can use it to draw a variety of shapes. Recall how you first generalized your original pinwheel script: you added an input variable called branches that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding more input variables, you can generalize other aspects of your program...

Experiment with the input for the second move block inside your pinwheel block as shown below. First predict. What do you think will happen? Then try several inputs between -100 and 0.

What happened? How does it compare to what you predicted? How does this input value impact the sprite's behavior? How does it impact the resulting image on the stage?

* Add a second input variable to control the amount of "backing up" that the sprite does before each turn through the full 360Â°.
* Drag off the new backup variable, place it where it belongs in the pinwheel code, and press "OK" or "Apply."
* Check that the new input slot in the pinwheel block behaves like the changes in your experimentation above.
* Use an Operator block and change the pinwheel script so that it will accept a positive value (between 0 and 100) for backup.
* Add a third input called size to control the input to the first move block.

Try out a variety of inputs to your pinwheel program...

Discuss what input values will give you a polygon or an asterisk.

You may want to reduce the input value for the wait blocks inside the pinwheel script so you don't have to wait so long between trials.
